# GifTastic
In this application we used the Giphy API to pull gifs on topics that we were interested

 in. We used jQuery to append 10 gifs related to the topics that were on each button. We 
 
 also appended buttons from user input. Hope you enjoy this Giphy application. But.. Do 
 
 you even gif, bro?
